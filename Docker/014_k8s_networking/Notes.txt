Within-Pod Communication
    Localhost can be used inside a pod to communicate to another container

Services
    Used for pod-to-pod communication

    Can be accessed from other pods by <service_name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local 
        - forgot what cluster.local is called. I think it's like the h

    type: ClusterIP | LoadBalancer | NodePort | ExternalName
        * ClusterIP: Only reachable within the cluster. Externally blocked
        * LoadBalancer: The most common. Externally load balance with the cloud providers load balancing mechanism.
        * NodePort: Proxies a port on each node into your Services
        * ExternalName: Maps a Service to a DNS name instead of a typical selector. Cluster DNS Service returns a CNAME record with the hostname value
            - Accessing the service normally by it's name works but the crucial difference is redirection happens at the DNS level rather than via proxying or forwarding
Ingress
    Used to expose ports outside the kubernetes cluster
