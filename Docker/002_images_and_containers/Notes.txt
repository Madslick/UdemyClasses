    -i = --interactive  
    -t =--tty (allocate a psudo-tty)
    -p <hostport>:<containerport>
    -rm to automatically delete on exit
    -d to run in detach mode
    --name to set a custom name

docker ps -a 
  - to see all docker containers (running and not running)

docker rm <container_name>

docker images 
  - to see all images
docker rmi <image_id>
  - to remove a docker image, have to remove all stopped containers of it first
