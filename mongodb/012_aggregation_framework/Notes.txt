Aggregation works in stages. Each stage receives the output of the previous stage

1. Match: match the documents in the result, (filter)
    - Filter & Sort here and take advantage of indexes
    - db.persons.aggregate([
        {
            $match: {
                // All traditional find filter functionality works here
            }
        }
    ])
2. Sort
3. Group
    * Group by a field or multiple fields
4. Project
