What is MongoDB?
    - It's a document based NoSQL Database.
    - MongoDB has Databases. Databases have Collections (tables). Collections have Documents (rows)
    - Schemaless which makes it easier to prototype
    - Uses JSON (BSON) Data format

Relations?
    - Should be kept to a minimum. Store duplicate data on the document instead 

Simple Commands
    use <db_name>
        Switches Databases

    db.dropDatabase()
        Deletes the database

    db.<collection>.insertOne({"name: "A Book", price: 12.99})
        Inserts a document into the collection

    db.<collection>.find()
        Can add .pretty() after find to pretty print the json output
