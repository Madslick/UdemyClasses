### USE CASES ###
Say you don't want to install npm on your host machine,
you can create a node container with a bind mount that can run npm init 
to instantiate the project without installing node on the host

# Ways to run commands in a container
docker exec <container name or id> COMMAND
docker run <image_name> COMMAND
docker exec container npm init
docker run -it container npm init

## ENTRYPOINT ##
Similar to CMD, set as last command in the Dockerfile
Entrypoint allows you to declare the command that can be called inside the container.
This way the container is restricted to just a singular command but is flexible.
Can still be run with different flags, options and arguments

## DOCKER COMPOSE ##
You can use docker-compose run for utility containers because up is mainly used to bring applications up
