Core Concepts
Containers are isolated boxes that contain the code and environment to run that code. Single task focused. Shareable/reproducible. Stateless (+ volumes)

Images are the blueprints for spinning up containers. They contain code + environment and are read only. Can be built + shared

Example of a multi-stage build dockerfile is here. Refer to module 9 for more explanations on multistage dockerfiles
