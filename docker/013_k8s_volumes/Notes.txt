Volume Types
Pod Volumes
    emptyDir type of volume lives on as long as the pod lives. Survives container restarts
        - Not great for loadbalanced pods bc it only lives on 1 pod

    hostPath: Mounts to the host rather than the container

    CSI is a volume type that is very dynamic. You can implement a driver interface to create an integration into it.

Persistent Volumes
    This type of volume is completely independent of the Pod lifecycle. The node could crash, the pod could be deleted and containers restarted/deleted and the persistent volume would persist.

    Setup
        you need to deploy a PersistentVolume resource along with a PersistentVolumeClaim resource. Now your Deployment can use the volume type persistentVolumeClaim to utilize the PV.

Environment Variables
    You can either use environment variables directly in the Deployment resource with the env property in containers.spec 
    OR
    You can setup a ConfigMap resource that abstracts the environment variable definitions away from the Deployment resource configuration.
